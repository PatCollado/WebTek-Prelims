						</header>
						<p class = "tab"> Having a CCTV installed is a great help for citizens to roam freely and feel secured at all times.
						Aside from businesses, barangays are now required to install CCTVs in their respective areas.</p>
						<p class = "tab"> Barangay Captain Jessie Jacob Palos Jr. said that Barangay Norte/Sur is strengthening their implementation 
						of peace and order by investing additional CCTVS of the barangay. Currently, the barangay have a total of 8 CCTVs installed. 
						3 of them are placed in the barangay hall and 5 of them are placed from the barangay hall until the turning point of the barangay. 
						Although this is still in talk because there are other factors to consider first, but Barangay Captain Palos ensures us that he will do his best 
						to pursue this proposal for the safety of the Barangay.

							<h3>“We need more tanods” – Barangay Captain Jessie Jacob Palos Jr.</h3>
						</header>
						<p class = "tab"> >Barangay Tanod or also known as Barangay police officer, Barangay peace and security officer, Barangay peacekeeping and security officer, 
						or Barangay police safety officer may be the lowest level of law enforcement officer in the Philippines but they play a vital role in the 
						development, progress and security of the barangay.</p>
						<p class = "tab"> Barangay Bakakeng have a total of 4 tanods. 1 tanod is incharge during morning while 3 
						tanods are incharge to roam at night. “We really need more tanods” – Barangay Captain Jessie Jacob Palos told us. When we ask the reason 
						why they only have a small number of tanods, he replied “There are no volunteers because everyone is busy here. There are no tambays here. 
						We actually offered them a salary higher than some barangays but there are still no volunteers. “ With this situation, Barangay Captain 
						sometimes asks the Station 10 pulis to help them make the barangay safe especially at night.
