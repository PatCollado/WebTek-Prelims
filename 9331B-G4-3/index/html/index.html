	   <h2> Environmental Protection </h2>
    </div>
    <p id="par1">
		The world we live in today is suffering environmental problems, like air pollution and climate </br>
		change, and it continues to worsen by the day. With the continuing degradation of our environment, </br>
		it is up to us to help with its protection and what better place there is to start than our very own homes.</br>

		This is encouraged by Barangay Bakakeng Norte/Sur. The Barangay prohibits burning any kind </br>
		of material within the barangay for it causes air pollution and it can contribute to the </br>
		ever present problem of Global Warming. </br>
	</p>

	<p id="par3">
		Dealing with garbage is also strict in the barangay. Throwing your garbage in canals or </br>
		leaving them on the streets is not allowed. They also encourage households to segregate their </br>
		garbage because they have a "No segregation, No collection" policy where garbages will not </br>
		be collected if they are not segregated. </br>
	</p>

	<p id="par4">

		</br>
		Recycling is also encouraged in the barangay. Recycling is the act of transforming waste </br>
		into something new, something that can be used again. Recycling is part of the 3 R's, Reduce, </br>
		Reuse, and Recycle. The 3 R's aims to reduce the amount of waste materials that couls still </br>
		be used, reducing consumption of materials so there would be less waste materials, and </br>
		recycling waste materials. </br>
	</p>

	<p id="par5">
		The barangay also works with the neighboring university, Saint Louis University Maryheights </br>
		Campus, to conduct its annual tree planting programs. Trees are beneficial to the protection </br>
		of the environment especially here in Baguio City. Trees help in dealing with the inevitable </br>
		and evident air pollution in the city brought by by toxic gases released by the thousands</br>
		of vehicles in the city. </br>
