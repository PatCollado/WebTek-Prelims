			The world we live in today is suffering environmental problems, </br>
			like air pollution and climate change, and it continues to worsen </br>
			by the day. With the continuing degradation of our environment,</br>
			it is up to us to help with its protection and what better place</br>
			there is to start than our very own homes.</br>
	</p>

	<p id="par2">
			This is encouraged by Barangay Bakakeng Norte/Sur.</br>
			The Barangay prohibits burning any kind of material within </br>
			the barangay for it causes air pollution and it can contribute </br>
			to the ever present problem of Global Warming.</br>
			
	</p>

	<p id="par3">
			 Dealing with garbage is also strict in the barangay.</br>
			 Throwing your garbage in canals or leaving them on the </br>
			 streets is not allowed. They also encourage households to </br>
			 segregate their garbage because they have the “No segregation,</br>
			 no collection” policy where garbage will not be collected if </br>
			 they are not segregated.</br>
			
	</p>

	<p id="par4">
			Recycling is also encouraged in the barangay.</br>
			Recycling is the act of transforming waste material</br> 
			into something new, something that can be used again.</br>
			Recycling is part of the 3 R’s, Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle.</br>
			The 3 R’s aims to reduce to the amount of waste that is </br>
			thrown by simply reusing waste materials that could still be used, </br>
			reducing consumption of materials so there would be less waste materials,</br> 
			and recycling waste materials.</br>
			
	</p>

	<p id="par5">
			The barangay also works with the neighboring university,</br>
			Saint Louis University Maryheights Campus, to conduct its </br>
			annual tree planting programs. Trees are beneficial to </br>
			the protection of the environment especially here in Baguio City.</br>
			Trees help in dealing with the inevitable and evident air pollution </br>
			in the city brought by toxic gases released by thousands of cars in the city.</br>
