<h1> About </h1>
<p> 
    Situated 10-15 minutes (depending on the traffic) away from Baguio City's main town proper, </br>\
    Bakakeng resides peacefully surrounded with trees, providing a good environment to put up a </br>
    house and start a family. Bakakeng can be accessed from two main highways, Marcos and Kennon </br>
    with the former being commonly used by studentsof the Saint Louis University, built at the </br>
    center of the barangay and gives life to Bakakeng. </br>
